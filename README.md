Premier League Match Predictor
Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict English Premier League match outcomes. The predictor uses historical match data, team statistics, and rolling averages to forecast match results with a focus on identifying winning probabilities. The model employs Random Forest Classification to capture complex patterns in football match dynamics.
Project Aim
The primary objectives of this project are:

Develop a reliable prediction model for Premier League match outcomes
Utilize rolling averages of team performance metrics for improved accuracy
Account for various factors including venue, timing, and historical performance
Provide actionable insights for match result predictions

Libraries Used
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn: Machine learning implementation (RandomForestClassifier)
Custom utilities for data preprocessing and feature engineering

Code Structure
The main predictor code can be found in predictor.py. The repository structure is as follows:

├── predictor.py          # Main prediction model implementation
├── requirements.txt      # Required Python packages
└── README.md            # Project documentation

Data
The dataset can be found on matches.csv

The dataset includes:

Match dates and venues
Team and opponent information
Match statistics (goals, shots, possession, etc.)
Final match results

The data preprocessing pipeline includes:

Date and time formatting
Categorical encoding of venues and teams
Generation of rolling averages for key statistics
Feature engineering for improved prediction accuracy

Key Findings and Observations
The implemented Random Forest model shows promising results in predicting match outcomes. Key observations include:

The model achieves approximately 66% accuracy (29/44) in predicting decisive matches
Rolling averages of team performance metrics significantly improve prediction accuracy
Venue and timing factors play important roles in match outcomes
The model performs better when predicting matches for teams with consistent performance patterns

Future Improvements
Potential enhancements for the project include:

Integration of player-specific statistics
Consideration of team formation and tactics
Implementation of more sophisticated feature engineering
Real-time data updates and predictions
